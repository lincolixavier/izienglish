description: "Sejam bem vindos ao GUIA COMPLETO DO VERBO ‚ÄúTO BE‚Äù"

---

Quando o assunto √© aprender ingl√™s, √© quase un√¢nime que a primeira coisa que vem na cabe√ßa √© o famoso verbo ‚Äúto be‚Äù.  E esse verbinho vem aterrorizando v√°rias pessoas desde os primeiros anos de Ingl√™s seja nas escolas ou em cursos de idioma. 

O fato √© que, o verbo ‚Äúto be‚Äù √© realmente importante para dar in√≠cio no aprendizado do ingl√™s pois ele √© utilizado quase que o tempo inteiro na l√≠ngua inglesa. Seja para falar sobre caracter√≠sticas, localiza√ß√£o e outros casos que ele se faz presente.

O grande desafio para falantes da l√≠ngua portuguesa √© que o tal do verbo ‚Äúto be‚Äù √© equivalente a dois de nossos verbos. Sim, isso mesmo, um verbo do ingl√™s tem o mesmo peso e altura de dois de nossos verbos. 

E o problema est√° a√≠, exatamente a√≠.

Se n√£o for compreendido, o novo aprendiz do ingl√™s pode ficar confuso e acabar n√£o entendendo nada desse verbo t√£o simples.



```html
<template>
  <Layout>
    <h2>Latest blog posts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="edge in $page.allWordPressPost.edges" :key="edge.node.id">
        {{ edge.node.title }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Layout>
</template>

<page-query>
query Blog {
  allWordPressPost (limit: 5) {
    edges {
      node {
        _id
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
</page-query>
```

You don't need to know GraphQL or Vue to get started with Gridsome - It's a great way to get introduced to both.


The GraphQL layer and all the data can be explored in a local GraphQL playground. The playground is usually located at `https://localhost:8080/___explore` when a Gridsome development project is running.




#### Perfect scores on Google Lighthouse - automagically üíö

One of the main goals of Gridsome is to make a framework that let you build websites that are optimized "out-of-the-box." It follows the [PRPL-pattern by Google.](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/) You don't need to be a performance expert to make fast websites with Gridsome. Your site gets almost perfect scores on Google lighthouse out-of-the-box. These are some of the performance steps that Gridsome takes care of:

- Image compressing & lazy-loading ‚ö°Ô∏è 
- CSS & JS minification ‚ö°Ô∏è 
- Code-splitting ‚ö°Ô∏è 
- HTML compressing ‚ö°Ô∏è 
- Critical CSS (Plugin) ‚ö°Ô∏è 
- Full PWA & Offline-support (plugin) ‚ö°Ô∏è  


#### A better way to build websites

Gridsome is built for the JAMstack workflow - a new way to build websites that gives you better performance, higher security, cheaper hosting, and a better developer experience. Generate prerendered (static) pages at build time for SEO-purpose and add powerful dynamic functionality with APIs and Vue.js.

We believe the SSGs / JAMstack trend is just getting started. When you have first started to make websites this way there is no way back. You feel almost "dirty" when going back to a traditional WordPress / CMS setup. 

Try running the new Chrome Lighthouse (Audit tab in Developer tools) on a WordPress site - It is impossible to get good scores even with the best caching plugins and hosting. With Gridsome you don't even need caching plugins. Website optimization is taken care of at build time.

This is what we think is very exciting and is why we are building Gridsome. It is the **perfect SPA & PWA front-end solution** for any headless CMS or content APIs.


#### Whats next

In the next couple of months we're going to continue to improve the docs, create tutorials, add more source & transformer plugins and fix bugs. 

#### Contribute to Gridsome

We're currently just two brothers working on this, so any contribution is very welcome. We're passionate about building a faster web and make website building fun again.

You can also support us by giving [a GitHub star ‚òÖ](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/stargazers) and spread the word :)
